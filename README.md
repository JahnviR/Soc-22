# SOC : INTRODUCTION TO WEB3.0

## Checkpoint 1

### Week 1
*	Basics of HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript were learned in week 1 through YouTube video tutorials.
###	Week 2
*	In week 2, React.js was learned in a hands-on manner through the website scrimba.com which had practice problems along with the topics, within the website itself.
###	Week 3
*	The basic idea behind Web3, blockchains, Ethereum, bitcoin etc. and the concept of decentralization was obtained.
###	Week 4 (ongoing)
*	Started learning Solidity

A project implemented in Week 2 using React.js has been uploaded.

## Checkpoint 2
### Introduction
* Web 3 (also known as Web 3.0) is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on blockchain technology, which incorporates concepts such as decentralization and token-based economics.

### Core ideas of Web3
* Decentralized: instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users.
* Permissionless: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.
* Native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.
* Trustless: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.

In web3, developers don't usually build and deploy applications that run on a single server or that store their data in a single database. But, Web3 applications either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer to peer nodes (servers), or a combination of the two that forms a cryptoeconomic protocol. These apps are often referred to as dapps (decentralized apps). 

To achieve a stable and secure decentralized network, network participants (developers) are incentivized and compete to provide the highest quality services to anyone using the service. Cryptocurrency provides a financial incentive (tokens). These protocols may often offer a variety of different services like compute, storage, bandwidth, identity, hosting etc.

Another entity of Web3 which is gaining tremendous momentum and investment from both traditional developers and venture capital firms is a DAO or “Decentralized Autonomous Organization”. It is a community-led entity with no central authority. It is fully autonomous and transparent: smart contracts lay the foundational rules, execute the agreed upon decisions, and at any point, proposals, voting, and even the very code itself can be publicly audited. 

Web3 contracts, also called smart contracts are agreements between two or more parties over the internet. Web3 contracts are self-executing agreements. Instead of needing third parties or professionals to implement such agreements, they employ code. These digital contracts enable many functions, including buying, selling, and trading assets. Furthermore, with Web3 contracts, you can exchange various currencies, tokens, or types of property.

### Importance 
* Web3 gives you ownership of your digital assets in an unprecedented way and allows for direct ownership through non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
* It allows censorship resistance as your data lives on the blockchain.
* Web3 allows you to control your digital identity with an Ethereum address and ENS profile. Using an Ethereum address provides a single login across platforms that is secure, censorship-resistant and anonymous.

### Some limitations
* Important Web3 features, like Sign-in with Ethereum, are already available for anyone to use at zero cost. But, the relative cost of transactions is still prohibitive to many. Web3 is less likely to be utilized in less-wealthy, developing nations due to high transaction fees.
* Web3 isn't difficult, but it is different. Therefore, people need to be educated about it.

A project covering the basics of Solidity (Week 5-6) has been uploaded.
